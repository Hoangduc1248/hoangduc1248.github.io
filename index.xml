      <description>Hello every one! Today I will talk about my very first trip to attend a conference at Tohoku University.
This trip contain of so many first things of mine.
First time to Sendai, JAPAN Sendai is one of the biggest city in Tohoku. This city is totally different from my city which is called Aizu Wakamatsu city (The smallest city of Fukushima).
Me and Hoang (My senior) go there by bus. And when we got there, we have to wait for my professor and Thang (My another senior). At that time, I and Hoang make a friend with an Indian. He is very nice, proactive and he also a developer. He currently works in Tokyo Japan, but he went to Sendai for a trip to meet his friend and then he was waiting for the bus come back to Tokyo. I always like to make a friend from other countries, It was nice to try to practice your English.
Finally, my professor came, he introduced us to a very delicious restaurant under the Sendai station. He said that this is his favorite food in Sendai. After that, we talk about so many things. Every time I talk with my professor I learn well.</description>
