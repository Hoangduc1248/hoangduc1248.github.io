      <description>Brief: A first IEEE conference of mine. I will talk about that I think about Fukuoka.
First of all this conference is a must have step to apply for my new scholarship which is called Rotary-Yoneyama. A very nice scholarship not only on amount of money every month, It also good about to have a very success Japanese consultant. Suddenly, this time I want to learn more about tax, and economy and then it will be nice to have this scholarship.
Morning 18 September 2018, I take a bus to go to Niigata, a beautiful nearby city which have a domestic airport. Wow first time go to the Southern of Japan, a bit excited and I thought that: What is waiting for me in Fukuoka? A new journey? I always like to explore and learn a new thing. This is the life we should learn a new thing or just going to die right away.
After two hours in the sky, I arrive to Fukuoka. DO you know what is my first impressive? A big city compare to my living city and very overcrowded, many thing new, my eye feel so excited. As a sense of a animal, look at the Google map I found out that we have a castle.</description>

      <description>Hello every one! Today I will talk about my very first trip to attend a conference at Tohoku University.
This trip contain of so many first things of mine.
First time to Sendai, JAPAN Sendai is one of the biggest city in Tohoku. This city is totally different from my city which is called Aizu Wakamatsu city (The smallest city of Fukushima).
Me and Hoang (My senior) go there by bus. And when we got there, we have to wait for my professor and Thang (My another senior). At that time, I and Hoang make a friend with an Indian. He is very nice, proactive and he also a developer. He currently works in Tokyo Japan, but he went to Sendai for a trip to meet his friend and then he was waiting for the bus come back to Tokyo. I always like to make a friend from other countries, It was nice to try to practice your English.
Finally, my professor came, he introduced us to a very delicious restaurant under the Sendai station. He said that this is his favorite food in Sendai. After that, we talk about so many things. Every time I talk with my professor I learn well.</description>
